# A Tour Of Go Exercises
As I progressed through [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/) while learning Golang, I was slightly annoyed by how my edits would be reset after a while, so I decided to save my answers to the exercises on this repo. Some answers are quite similar to the [official ones](https://github.com/golang/tour/tree/master/solutions), in part as a coincidence and in part because i occasionally had a look when I was stuck. Nevertheless, I reccommend trying them out for yourselves if you're also interested in learning the language, and hope you al have a great day!
